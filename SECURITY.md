# Security policy

This project is intentionally narrow: it displays Codex usage status and nothing else.

## Hard boundaries

- It does not read, print, store, upload, transform, or proxy tokens, cookies, sessions, OAuth credentials, refresh tokens, or API keys.
- It does not read `~/.codex/auth.json`.
- It does not scrape browser state, browser cookies, web pages, screenshots, or OCR output.
- It does not simulate login or retry login flows.
- It does not modify the official Codex app bundle.
- It does not attempt to bypass, increase, reset, purchase, or route around usage limits.

## Data source

The only supported live data source is the official local Codex app-server method:

```json
{"method":"account/rateLimits/read","id":1}
```

Codex itself owns authentication and calls its own backend. This project receives only the structured rate-limit response returned by app-server.

## Refresh policy

The default menu-bar refresh interval is 60 seconds. Keep refreshes conservative; usage status does not need sub-second polling.

## If this stops working

Stop at the official boundary. Do not add cookie scraping, token extraction, browser automation, OCR, or patched-app workarounds as fallbacks.
